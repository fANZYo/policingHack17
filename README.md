Policing hackathon 2017

## The problem
The current system by which police officers communicate information to victims is painful and can lead to arguments going back and forth. This can often lead to degrading officer mental wellbeing.

## Our solution
A communication system to share updates on the investigation of a crime, combined with notifications, status and further information regarding the progress of the investigation and optional information explaining some of the reasoning behing the decisions made by the officer.
